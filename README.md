# lung-cancer-analysis
Lung cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the lungs. Lungs are two spongy organs in our chest that take in oxygen when we inhale and release carbon dioxide when we exhale. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide.

This project thoroughly analyzed a lung cancer survey dataset and developed various machine - learning models for lung cancer prediction. It completed a full - scale data science workflow, spanning data exploration, visualization, advanced model building, and evaluation.

During data exploration, charts visualized lung cancer patients' age distribution, sex ratio, and the link between risk factors and lung cancer. The analysis confirmed close connections between behaviors like smoking, drinking and lung cancer, and found the distribution features of symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, and fatigue in patients. Feature correlation analysis pinpointed factors most related to lung cancer diagnosis.

The project implemented diverse machine - learning models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes (Gaussian and Bernoulli), Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, K - Nearest Neighbors, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Networks. Through training and evaluation, it compared their performances in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

For comprehensive assessment, it created visualizations like ROC curves, confusion matrices, PR curves, cumulative gains charts, and lift charts. These not only showed each model's performance but also used advanced techniques such as confidence intervals for deeper insights.

Results showed model performance differences across metrics. The best models were identified through overall evaluation, offering high - precision tools for lung cancer prediction. This study demonstrated leveraging data analysis and machine - learning to extract value from medical data, supporting early lung cancer detection and risk assessment.
